# FrostBiz
Business managing dashboard based on the UI of Frostpunk (game about managing a city on the extreme cold).

Here are the game elements and their equivalent on FrostBiz:

temperature = run way
worker types = bussines owner can customize (examples: cook,delivery driver,programmer,marketer,welder,assistant,etc)
coal in stockpile = money in the bank account
show casflow at the top
day count remains the same as the game
quests = the business owner creates his own objectives
outpost team = delivery driver for the company product
business owner can creates his own resources if he wants,just find a icon online lol

discontent: once per workday employee survey 
hope:  once per workday employee survey  (scale 1-10)

book of laws = place where company policy gets published

view map/go to the city = view google maps of delivery guys/see the business
